The team just returned to sea to recover, refurbish, and re-deploy our key instrumentation in the head of Astoria Canyon aboard the RV Sproul. With serial cables and 540-Wh battery packs in hand, we were able to recover all our data, program our instruments, re-battery them, and send them back down for another six months. Below is a timelapse of the recovery operation.
