The USGS Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center is fresh off an 11-day cruise aboard the Eclipse Group's new vessel, the Swift Responder. This 196 foot vessel was originally used in marine spill mitigation and remediation, but its spacious back deck also makes it a suitable vessel for the large  coring apparatus required to collect 10 meter-long cores from the continental shelf, submarine canyons, and deformation front offshore northern Washington. The cruise enjoyed calm seas, a fun and hardworking crew, and plenty of brand new core data for the team to analyze. 

The cores collected on this cruise represent the longest sediment records ever collected from Quinault Canyon, and some of the first ever core samples of the northern WA deformation front. Without revealing too much, we'll say that the surficial geology of Quinault Canyon, though proximal to Astoria Canyon, could not be more different! Stay tuned for the high quality datasets and publications to come... And in the meantime, please enjoy this video shot aboard the vessel.
