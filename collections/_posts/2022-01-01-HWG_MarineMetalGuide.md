When choosing metal hardware for oceanographic moorings intended for long-term deployments, corrosion resistance and tension rating are the primary considerations. Marine environments are harsh on metals due to exposure to saltwater. 

To combat corrosion, galvanized hardware or stainless steel (304- or 316-grade) is often preferred for shackles, swivels, and bolts because of its balance between strength and corrosion resistance. Galvanic corrosion is a major gotcha to avoid, however -- this occurs when two metals of dissimilar corrodability are in direct contact and the "softer" metal rapidly corrodes. It is crucial to match metal types when in contact and, if necessary, use insulating materials between dissimilar components. For particularly critical components, titanium or specialized high-nickel alloys like Hastelloy may be warranted, as they provide exceptional durability in aggressive marine conditions.

Beyond corrosion mitigation, the design and load rating of each piece of hardware must be matched to the anticipated environmental stresses. All components should have a working load limit (WLL) comfortably above the maximum expected tensions, accounting for dynamic forces from currents, wave action, and possible entanglement with debris. All metal hardware should undergo pre-deployment inspection for manufacturing defects, proper fit with neighboring components, and signs of surface contamination that could accelerate corrosion. 


## Key points:
 - 1. Avoid connecting galvanized and stainless hardware
 - 2. thou shall use zincs to preserve instruments and frames
 - 3. thou shall not skimp on metal thickness
