Modern turbidite deposits are often identified on the basis of their density structure in x-radiographs or CT scans. Low-density mud and high-density sand offers clear separation between event and non-event deposits, and as a result, sandy turbidites are easily identified in cores from the mud-rich Cascadia Continental margin. Many of these turbidites are attributed to sloughing from the canyon walls... But proximal canyon walls are predominantly draped in mud, so are there also examples of mud-rich mass transport deposits? These "cohesive debris flow" deposits are not well-represented in literature, perhaps owing to their subtle expression in density scans, core imagery, and geochemical data. We took a deep dive into our sediment core CT data to generate some clear examples of these deposits, and we found that these deposits can actually comprise a signficant portion of the sediment record in canyon channels on the upper slope. Here is one example of the CT expression of a debris flow. Centimeter-scale rounded clay clasts topped by laminated sands are two recurring observations from these deposits.
