***Sediment microstructure***  reveals the sedimentological details of a small area within a sediment core. Fine hand tools and minimally invasive sampling techniques are prioritized to extract a small window of sediment from a core without destroying delicate features including fine layers, cross-beds, and grain contacts.

To do this, a small slab of sediment is extracted into a metal tray and later embedded in epoxy. To perform the extraction, you'll need the following supplies:

    0.2 mm Aluminum sheeting (Al 1060)
    scissors
    drill & 5/64" bit
    taught-wire sediment cutter
    metal receptacle
    deionized water

***1. Create diffusion trays***  
Using thin aluminum sheeting, perform the following steps:

Measure and mark the dimensions of your tray on the [0.2 mm Aluminum sheeting](https://www.amazon.com/10pcs-0-2mm200mm200mm-99-6-Aluminum-Sheet/dp/B07G2WFVY2/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1DJIQZ54SMZIK&keywords=0.2mm+aluminum+sheet&qid=1675155035&sprefix=0.2mm+alum%2Caps%2C657&sr=8-3). Drill away about ~1/2 of the metal from the sheeting via regularly spaced ~5/64" holes. Cut out the tray body using a scissors. Fold the cut sheeting into the tray body, creasing the corners to 90 degrees.

I often make trays that are **10 x 30 x 50** mm thick. The Z dimension is is thin enough for diffusion-embedding, and the X-Y dimensions cover a standard thin section slide (26 x 46 mm) with a small margin of extra.

***2. Press and extract a diffusion tray***  
Expose a planar section of core sediment, and gently press the tray face down into the sediment until the back plate barely reaches the sediment surface. Press the taught-wire sediment cutting tool into the sediment at one end of the aluminum tray, and drag the wire across the face of the aluminum tray. At this point, a thin slab of sediment has been isolated in-situ in the core, but it still needs to be removed. From here, I rotate the core face to be nearly vertical, and torque out the tray while minimizing disturbance to the core and tray sediment.

From here, the diffusion tray can be transferred to the first bath of the diffusion embedding process. Below are photos documenting the key steps of a microstructure slab extraction from a fine-grained sediment core section.

This guide outlines how to embed a section of sediment core into epoxy resin which will bind particles in their *in-situ* position. It is based off the methodology of *Pike and Kemp* (1996), and it exploits fluid diffusion as the means of epoxy permeation into sediment pore space. This technique disturbs sedimentary structures less than alternative methods which involve freeze-drying or vacuum pumps. It is generally low cost (<$400).

The recipe below is for a single microstructure slab 10 x 30 x 50 mm, which roughly matches the size of a thin section slide from Precision Petrographics.

You'll need the following supplies:

    600 ml deionized water
    2.2 liters acetone (hardware grade works, lab grade is better)
    1.3 liters Spurr low-viscosity epoxy resin mixture, in this mass ratio:
        23.6 NSA Epoxy Hardener
        16.4 ERL 4221
        5.72 DER 736
        0.4  DMAE 2

And the following equipment:

    1 narrow strip of 0.2 mm aluminum sheeting
    1 tray to serve as a "diffusion bath"
    1 airtight container to seal the bath
    1 scale precise/accurate to within ~0.1 g
    15 disposable 200 ml syringes
    10 disposable plastic cups
    10 disposale stir sticks (I use disposable forks)

**Note:** The sediment microstructure slab is highly susceptible to deformation the moment it is extracted from the core. Keep it temperature stable, submerged in liquid, handle it minimally, and get it into epoxy curing as quickly as possible. Once you have all chemicals and supplies in hand, it's time to start the process of 1) desalination, 2) dehydration, and 3) epoxy embedding.
