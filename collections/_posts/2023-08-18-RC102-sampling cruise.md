The Cascadia canyons team just returned from a short cruise near the mouth of the Columbia River. We encountered challenging ocean swell and strong winds that made even the simplest of sampling tools challenging to operate, and we ultimately had to shut down operations early due to weather. It did not help that our sampling site was directly atop the Columbia River Bar, also known as the "graveyard of the Pacific". This site has a long history of shipwrecks due to the seabed morphology and proximity to the mouth of the Columbia River. These challenges are due to the shoaling bar bathymetry that amplifies waves, and the river which provides very strong currents at ebb tide. This can make holding the ship's position--and standing on two feet--quite the feat in strong weather.

The bad weather was asdfasdfasdfasdfsadfasd
