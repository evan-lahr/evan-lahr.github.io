The Cascadia canyons team just returned from a short cruise near the mouth of the Columbia River. We encountered challenging ocean swell and strong winds that made even the simplest of sampling tools challenging to operate, and we ultimately had to shut down operations due to weather. It did not help that our sampling site was the Columbia River Bar, also known as the "graveyard of the Pacific" due to its long history of shipwrecks. These challenges are due to the shoaling bar morphology that amplifies waves and the river which provides very strong currents at ebb tide. This can make holding the ship's position--and standing on two feet--quite the feat in bad weather.

Fortunately, we were able to complete a grid of sampling sites (see above) before high-tailing it for the strait of Juan de Fuca. These data will fill a critical gap in our characterization of the sediment sources to Astoria and Quinault canyons. On our return trip to UW, we passed through the Ballard locks--you can check out that transit below.
