Our haul of new core samples from Sikuliaq cruise SKQ202305S was recently subsampled at the OSU Marine Geology Repository, a geology repository in Corvallis Oregon. Or is it Core-vallis? The locals are probably sick of that one...

For this trip, we brought along our summer lab technicians--one undergraduate and one postgraduate student--to gain exposure to the state-of-the-art facilities and lab practices used to study the world's most important mud. The facility administrators, technicians, and pups we met along the way were nothing short of spectacular, and we can't wait for the chance to return. Below is a video we made to showcase the monstrous refrigerated core archive, and outline the tools we use to subsample, image, and archive our samples. Thanks to Owen, our undergrad tech, for showing us around. 

And to think, this is just the beginning of their journey through the lab!
