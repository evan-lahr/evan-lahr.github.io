Seafloor instrument frames hold many sensors, most of them expensive, and electronics don't like water. This guide aims to provide fundamental knowledge on the design and functionality of benthic instruments. The common components of benthic deployments are explained in each section, with an emphasis on the tips and tricks you might not read about in a formal setting. I deploy instruments on benthic tripods and taught wire moorings, so most of these posts will be in reference to preparing and deploying equipment on these frames.
