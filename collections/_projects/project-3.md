Submarine canyon turbidite stratigraphy in WA is used to infer seismic recurrence (1,2,3). This interpretation is often made under the assumption that turbidity flows are solely earthquake-driven sediment failures (e.g., no floods, storms, or other processes create turbidites). New evidence suggests canyons are more active than scientists initially believed (4,5,6,7,8). We want to know if this "highstand-dormant" conceptual model is valid offshore Washington, and we are collecting brand new turbidite records to explore turbidite sedimentology, age, and chemical composition.
