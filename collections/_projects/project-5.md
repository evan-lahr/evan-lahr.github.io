Submarine canyons are present along nearly every continental margin and are the sites of globally significant ocean mixing, sediment transport, and nutrient exchange between the coastal and abyssal environment. Earth’s submarine canyons are maintained by density-driven flows of water and sediment, but the mechanisms that trigger flows—and their downslope flow evolution—are still not comprehensively understood. This research program examines the pathways of sediment through two canyons along Cascadia Margin which are morphologically distinct yet share the same fluvial source. The contrasting canyons in this study, Astoria and Quinault, allow us to compare how processes are mediated by canyon morphology, addressing: seafloor sediment loading from fluvial sources, triggering of flows by the bathymetric focusing of wave and current energy, and synchronous downslope transport across distant canyon systems. We explore whether sedimentary deposits in relatively deep-water environments can be created via oceanic triggering, and aim to place constraints on the downslope limit of such flows.
