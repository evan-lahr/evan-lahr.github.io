Turbidity __ currents need sediment, but how is that sediment remobilized? Ocean currents, river discharge, and wave events are known to trigger turbidity currents in sites throughout the globe (9,10,11,12). Canyon axis hydrodynamics are notoriously difficult to predict and model (9,10,11,12), meaning that in order to catch these processes in action, we must deploy sensors to monitor canyons directly. Our coordinated sensor deployment will record the minute-by-minute, cm-scale current structure and bottom boundary layer across multiple canyon systems.
