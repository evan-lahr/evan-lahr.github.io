 I am a marine geologist focused on modern sediment transport from river mouths to the continental slope. In this website, you'll find a mix of oceanography and geology content intended to function as a set of notes for myself and others. I hope you find what you're looking for.

### research curriculum
 I study how continental margins fill and flush sediment in response to oceanographic and tectonic forces. Over the past 3 years, our team has made fundamental discoveries in submarine canyon systems, including that river floods can emplace large turbidite event layers in canyon channels, subduction zone earthquakes trigger massive cohesive debris flows, and that canyon flushing to the deep sea under subduction zone earthquake scenarios is variable and controlled by canyon morphology.
  

### analytical methods
My research methods span the water column and the seabed. To constrain water column properties, I employ acoustic and optical sensor data (ADCP, ADV, ABS, OBS). The sediment core tools I use address sedimentology (ct, microstructure, grain size, xrf), radioisotope geochronology (<sup>210</sup>Pb, <sup>137</sup>Cs, <sup>7</sup>Be, <sup>234</sup>Th, <sup>14</sup>C), and geochemistry ( δ<sup>13</sup>C,  δ<sup>15</sup>N, lignin oxidation products).
 
 More recently, I place an emphasis on accessible, open source, low cost ocean monitoring. To that end, I write and open source a wide variety of scripts and software packages to analyze geological data. I also develop low cost environmental monitoring solutions using remotely operated vehicles and micro-moorings. These designs are open source and highly capable, allowing robust data collection at >500 m and >100 km offshore for <$1000.


### funding and collaborators

  My work is currently supported by the National Science Foundation, USGS Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center, the Quaternary Research Center, and the University of Washington. Many of my projects are a collaboration between academic and government institutions with expertise in fluid mechanics, physical oceanography, and marine geology. The research featured in this website is funded primarily through NSF Award Number 2147983.
