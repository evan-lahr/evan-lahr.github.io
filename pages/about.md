 This project is a collaboration between the University of Washington and the USGS office in Santa Cruz. Jenna Hill (USGS) and Andrea Ogston (UW) are the principal investigators, supported by Kurt Rosenberger (USGS), and Evan Lahr (UW). Our team has expertise in fluid mechanics, physical oceanography, and marine geology.

# Our research goals.

### i. Should you trust a turbidite?

Submarine canyon turbidite stratigraphy in WA is used to infer seismic recurrence (1,2,3). This interpretation is often made under the assumption that turbidity flows are solely earthquake-driven sediment failures (e.g., no floods, storms, or other processes create turbidites). New evidence suggests canyons are more active than scientists initially believed (4,5,6,7,8). We want to know if this "highstand-dormant" conceptual model is valid offshore Washington, and we are collecting brand new turbidite records to explore turbidite sedimentology, age, and chemical composition.

### ii. What remobilizes canyon sediment?

Turbidity currents need sediment, but how is that sediment remobilized? Ocean currents, river discharge, and wave events are known to trigger turbidity currents in sites throughout the globe (9,10,11,12). Canyon axis hydrodynamics are notoriously difficult to predict and model (9,10,11,12), meaning that in order to catch these processes in action, we must deploy sensors to monitor canyons directly. Our coordinated sensor deployment will record the minute-by-minute, cm-scale current structure and bottom boundary layer across multiple canyon systems.

### iii. Can shear stress alone trigger turbidity currents?

Near-bed shear stress is one of the fundamental mechanisms of sediment resuspension. A site-specific knowledge of sediment resuspension threshold is a prerequisite to an understanding of turbidity current initiation. This relationship has not yet been published. A variety of seafloor characteristics, including the grain size distribution, porosity, and biogenic constituents can exert primary control on sediment resuspension. As part of this project, we aim to measure the seabed shear-resuspension parameters across
